                        users' and their Contacts' Personal Data and prevent any unauthorized use of it, as explained detailed in our Information Security Policy. If you believe that your privacy was treated in a way that was not in accordance with
                        this Privacy Policy, or if you believe that someone may have attempted to abuse our Services, please contact us at:

                        Additionally, in the event of a security incident in which we discover your Personal Data may have been at risk, we will take reasonable efforts to notify you and the applicable authority (if required to do so, subject to
                        applicable laws).
